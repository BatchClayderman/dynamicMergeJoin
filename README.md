# dynamicMergeJoin

This is a possible implementation for the dynamic merge join algorithm, including the static merge join algorithm, the static merge merging algorithm, and the dynamic merge merging algorithm. 

Both the Python scripts (3.x) and C++ source codes are provided. 

For C++ users, please use MSVC under Visual Studio (open the ``.sln`` file directly) on Windows platforms and ``g++`` to build on non-Windows platforms to build the program.
